# CA-Network-Analysis
This was a simple network analysis I conducted to measure the institutional interconnectedness of Central Asian militaries with each other and superpowers 
in the region and world. The files I attached are available to the public. I used the Correlates of War country code database to pull the names of the countries I needed
and the Alliance Treaty Obligations and Provisions dataset to pull the actual data. This was a basic visualization conducted for my senior thesis with the intention of
providing an introductory visualization explaining the disconnectedness of Central Asia's militaries.
